# LLM-Course-QA
This project is a question-answering system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide a platform for higher-education students to receive answers to course specific questions. The system uses information in course documents uploaded by instructors as its sources when responding to these queries. 
# High Level Architecture
This project is split into 4 main systems: frontend, backend, data ingestion and retrieval pipelines, and the large language model. 

The diagram below shows the resources used to deploy the application. For an in-depth description of our system architecture see the [High Level Architecture](./docs/HighLevelArchitecture.md)
